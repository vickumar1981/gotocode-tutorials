We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call or invoke it."

    "- **Private:** When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.\n",
    "- **Protected:** When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.\n",
